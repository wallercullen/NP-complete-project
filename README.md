# NP-complete-project

# Problem Description
Min graph coloring assigns a color to each verticies so that
1. No verticies that share an edge have the same color
2. The is no way to satisfy the above requirement with less colors

# Input Format
First line is an integer (N) for the number of edges.
The next N lines have two integers each (u and v) indentifing the verticies of each edge.

# Out Format
First line is an integer for the minimum number of colors.
A line with a list of verticies for each color.
